# RuleSet and Alias

A `RuleSet` & `Alias` provide a templates and reference mechanisms to keep support DRY (Don't-Repeat-Yourself) principles. The following definitions are used in the [CapabilityStatement](/HealthCare/fhir/CapabilityStatement) and [Questionnaire](/HealthCare/fhir/Questionnaires).

## Ruleset

adds markdown doc to a CapabilityStatement element

```
RuleSet: ResourceDocumentation(markdown)

* documentation = "{markdown}"
```

REST resource query/read-only operations

```
RuleSet: QuerySearchInteraction
* interaction[0].code = #read
* interaction[+].code = #vread
* interaction[+].code = #search-type
* versioning = #versioned
* readHistory = false
* updateCreate = false
* conditionalCreate = false
* conditionalRead = #not-supported
* conditionalUpdate = false
* conditionalDelete = #not-supported
```

## Alias

Defines am external URL for item control.

```
Alias: $questionnaire-item-control = http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control
```

> Note: these are not definitions in themselves and do not appear as artefacts in the Implementation Guide.
