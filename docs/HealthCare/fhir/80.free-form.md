# Free-form Documentation

Enrichment of user guidance, beyond the automatically generated canonical content, can authored using the mark-down content in the `input/pagecontent` directory. the `sushi init` provides a single `index.md` file to get started. This can be used to provide a site map to the resources, diagrams or static images

``` md
[Patient Profile](/StructureDefinition-PatientProfile.html) supports New Zealand context, for example MƒÅori ethnicity.
```

## Static Content

All assets are placed in the `input/images` directory, for example png, svg or non-image files, such as an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) in YAML format. These are published to the root directory.

``` md
New Zealand Patient use case ![alt text](/use-case.png "Use Case")
Also available [OAS.yaml](/OAS.yaml)
```

## PlantUML Diagrams

Instead of using static images, you can defined diagrams-as-code using PlantUML files in the `input/images-source` directory. These require HTML tags to use.

``` md
<div width="70%">
<!-- Generated from `input/images-source/use-case.plantuml` -->
{% include use-case.svg %}
</div>
```
