# Capability Statement

A `CapabilityStatement` is a resource that defines the functionalities provided by or required from a FHIR server. It describes the capabilities of a FHIR implementation, such as supported operations, interactions, and profiles.

- Usage of Profiles in CapabilityStatements: In a CapabilityStatement, profiles are used to declare which resource profiles are supported by the FHIR server. This helps clients understand how to interact with the server and what kind of data is expected or required.

Example:

```
{
  "resourceType": "CapabilityStatement",
  "status": "active",
  "date": "2024-06-04",
  "kind": "instance",
  "fhirVersion": "4.0.1",
  "format": ["json"],
  "rest": [{
    "mode": "server",
    "resource": [{
      "type": "Patient",
      "profile": "http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/MyPatientProfile"
    }]
  }]
}
```

- In this example, the CapabilityStatement indicates that the server supports the Patient resource constrained by MyPatientProfile.
