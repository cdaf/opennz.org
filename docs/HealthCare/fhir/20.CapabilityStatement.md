# Capability Statement

A `CapabilityStatement` is an instance resource that defines the functionalities provided by or required from a FHIR server. It describes the capabilities of a FHIR implementation, such as supported operations, interactions, and profiles. 

This produces the OpenAPI Specification. Start with a minimum required definition

```
Instance: PatientSummaryCapabilityStatement
InstanceOf: CapabilityStatement
Usage: #definition

* name = "PatientSummaryCapabilityStatement"
* title = "Patient Summary"
* status = #draft
* date = "2024-09-09"
* kind = #instance
* fhirVersion = #4.0.1
* format = #json
```

## Implementation

The URL will be "servers" in the resulting OAS.

```
* implementation.description = "Patient Summary"
* implementation.url = "https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4B"
```

## REST Declaration

Start with a minimum operation of search only.

```
* rest.mode = #server
* rest.interaction.code = #transaction
* rest.resource[+].type = #Condition
* rest.resource[=].profile = Canonical(PatientProfile|0.0.1)
* rest.resource[=] insert QuerySearchInteraction
* rest.resource[=] insert ResourceDocumentation([[Retrieve a summary of patient conditions, immunizations & medical alerts.]])
```

## Search Parameters

Ensure the search parameter is available in https://hl7.org/fhir/searchparameter-registry.html

```
* rest.resource[=].searchParam[0].name = "patient"
* rest.resource[=].searchParam[=].definition = "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/clinical-patient"
* rest.resource[=].searchParam[=].type = #reference
* rest.resource[=].searchParam[=].documentation = "Who has the assistance need?"
```

# Profile Artefacts

The resulting Implementation Guide now has the PatientSummaryCapabilityStatement.

![alt text](/img/PatientSummaryCapabilityStatement.png "CapabilityStatement artefact")

and within the PatientSummaryCapabilityStatement, is an automatically generated OpenAPI Specification.

# OpenAPI Specification Compatibility

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) generated may not be suitable for all tools, i.e. schema definitions by URL reference

``` json
"schema": {
  "$ref": "https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/fhir.schema.json#/definitions/Bundle"
}
```

an alternate generation is tool, but can only be used for self-hosted builds. See [OAS Generation Tool](/HealthCare/fhir/OAS-Generation-Tool).

## Swagger

Use this tool to visualise https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/ your resulting interface contract. To install your own, either server side or client side, see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui. This has been implemented in [FSH] FHIR Shorthand Implementation Guide.
