# SNOMED CT

Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is a comprehensive, multilingual healthcare terminology that provides a standardized way to represent clinical information in electronic health records (EHRs). SNOMED CT is widely used for recording patient data, facilitating interoperability between healthcare systems, and supporting clinical decision-making, research, and reporting.

SNOMED CT is maintained and distributed by SNOMED International, and it includes terms for diseases, clinical findings, procedures, body structures, organisms, and other clinical concepts, making it one of the most extensive medical terminologies available.
