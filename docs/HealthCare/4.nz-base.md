# New Zealand Base Implementation Guide

As this material focuses on Open Standards in a New Zealand context, we now move into our specific extensions. Similar to SNOMED, there are extensions to the Implementation Guides which provide value and compliance capabilities. e.g. Macron support for Te reo Māori.

See the [HL7® FHIR® New Zealand Base Implementation Guide](https://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/index.html), the _Official URL_ is used in the dependency reference below.

To use these extensions, add the following dependency to `sushi-config.yaml`.

```
dependencies:
  fhir.org.nz.ig.base: 
    uri: http://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/ImplementationGuide/fhir.org.nz.ig.base
    version: current
```

## FHIR Shorthand Validation

Using these extensions are described in the [FHIR Shorthand (FSH)](/category/fhir-shorthand-fsh). To check the FSH notation without building the compplete implementaiton guide, use

```
