# Purpose

The purpose of this material is to provide a collation of Open Standards in a New Zealand context. Within each sector, I hope to provide fast-track material, based on the experiences of learning what can be daunting sets of documentation.

## Why?

I have found each sector has a very steep learning curve with the guides and documentation going too deep, too fast. Global standards have to cater for complexities of language, taxation, time-zones, etc. whereas in New Zealand we have a relatively simple scope of compliance and social requirements.

My approach to this documentation is learning from my experiences of "Oh, I wish someone told me that on day 1!".
